\title{Batch geocoding with multiple services}
\usage{
euiss_batch_geocode(
  locations,
  services = c("nominatim"),
  api_keys = list(),
  prefer_accuracy = TRUE,
  verbose = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{locations}{Character vector of location names to geocode.}

\item{services}{Vector of services to try: "nominatim", "google", "bing".}

\item{api_keys}{Named list of API keys for commercial services.}

\item{prefer_accuracy}{Logical. Prefer more accurate but slower services first?}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print detailed progress?}
}
\value{
Data frame with geocoding results and service metadata.
}
\description{
This function provides robust geocoding by trying multiple services
in sequence for better success rates.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Basic multi-service geocoding
locations <- c("Paris, France", "London, UK", "Berlin, Germany")
results <- euiss_batch_geocode(locations)

# With commercial services (requires API keys)
results <- euiss_batch_geocode(
  locations,
  services = c("google", "nominatim"),
  api_keys = list(google = "your_api_key")
)
}
