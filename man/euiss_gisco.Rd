\usage{
euiss_gisco(
  res = "60",
  verbose = TRUE,
  type = "countries",
  shp = "RG",
  bordertype = "INLAND",
  year = "2024",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{Resolution of the map data. Options: "60", "20", "10", "03", "01" (in million scale).}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to print additional information during execution.}

\item{type}{Type of geographic data. Currently, only "countries" is supported.}

\item{shp}{Shape of the data. Options: "RG" (regions), "BN" (boundaries), "LB" (labels).}

\item{bordertype}{Type of boundary for "BN" shape. Options: "INLAND" or "COASTL".}

\item{year}{Year of the NUTS regulation. Options: "2024", "2020", "2016", "2013", "2010", "2006", "2003".}

\item{crs}{Coordinate reference system. Options: "4326" (WGS84), "3035" (ETRS 1989), "3857" (Web Mercator).}

\item{data_path}{Base path for GISCO data. If NULL, uses configured paths from euiss_configure_paths().}
}
\value{
A Simple Features (sf) object containing the requested geographic data.
}
\description{
This function fetches geographic data from the Eurostat GISCO service based on specified parameters.
The data is retrieved from local shapefile archives with support for different spatial types, 
resolutions, years, projections, boundary types, and country subsets.
}
\details{
This function expects GISCO data to be downloaded and available locally. The data structure
should follow GISCO's naming conventions:
\code{ref-countries-YYYY-SSm.shp.zip} where YYYY is year and SS is resolution.

Use \code{euiss_check_gisco_data()} to verify available data files.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Retrieve countries at 20M resolution for 2024 in WGS84
countries <- euiss_gisco(res = "20", verbose = TRUE)

# Get country boundaries only
boundaries <- euiss_gisco(res = "10", shp = "BN", bordertype = "COASTL")

# Get country labels/centroids
labels <- euiss_gisco(res = "20", shp = "LB")
}
